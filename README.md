# reproducibleResearchProject
### Project for the subject _Scientific Methodology and Performance Evaluation_, as part of my MOSIG M2 program.
I have choosen to do a brief analysis on data freely available online about the relation between the price of wheat and the wages of workers in England over a period of time.

I have chosen to do so in the format of a jupyter notebook, using the Python library _Pandas_ to help me parse, clean and process the data, as well as _Matplotlib_ to generate some interesting graphics. 

The context: "William Playfair was one of the pioneers of the graphical presentation of data, being credited in particular with the invention of the histogram. One of his famous graphs, taken from his book "A Letter on Our Agricultural Distresses, Their Causes and Remedies", shows the evolution of the wheat price and average salaries from 1565 to 1821. Playfair did not publish his raw data because reproducibility was not yet a topic in his days. But numbers obtained from a scan of the graph are available for download, the CSV version being most convenient."
